🛠️ M0609 Collaborative Robot Control Project
This repository demonstrates a project controlling Doosan Robotics' M0609 collaborative robot. Using the DART Platform and ROS 2, we implemented and tested a direct teaching method to efficiently control the robot.

✨ Key Features
DART Platform Integration:
Control and monitor the robot's status using Doosan Robotics' DART platform.
ROS 2 Integration:
Implemented robot state control and data communication within the ROS 2 environment.
Direct Teaching Functionality:
Easily set up task paths by manually moving the robotic arm.
