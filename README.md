## 🛠️ Collaborative Robot(M0609:Doosan Robotics)
This project explores the control capabilities of the M0609 collaborative robot using DART Platform and a ROS2. 
<br>we successfully executed tasks such as precise gear assembly, refined material handling, and Stacking Cups.
<br><br> **두산 로보틱스의 협동로봇인 M0609를 활용하여 다양한 상황에서 과제를 해결하는 프로젝트를 진행하였다.**
<br><br>

## ✨ Key Features

**Optimization**

- Implemented algorithms to estimate paths while analyzing singularity locations caused by joint angles and devising strategies to avoid them.

**Advanced Path Planning Algorithms**

- Designed optimal movements using not only linear and curved paths but also spline curves, achieving smooth and efficient robot operations
