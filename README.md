# 🛠️ Collaborative Robot Control Project
This project explores the control capabilities of the M0609 collaborative robot using the Direct Teaching, DART Platform, Teaching Pendant,and a ROS 2. The study focused on discovering intuitive and flexible methods for task path configuration and robot operation.

By leveraging Compliance Control and Force Control, we successfully executed tasks such as precise gear assembly (insertion tasks), refined material handling (precision-optimized operations), Jenga, and Stacking Cups.
These experiments deepened our understanding of the collaborative robot's mechanisms and validated efficient control strategies for real-world applications.
